# Pixelated API

Hosted Fastify control plane for PIXELATED Studio. The API is the browser-facing data boundary for authenticated app workflows and the server-to-engine verifier for cloud game boot.

## Scope

The API owns:

- Supabase JWT verification, roles, permissions, and profile access.
- Catalog reads, featured games, favorites, reactions, comments, reports, and moderation.
- Admin users, reports, submissions, catalog candidates, and access logs.
- Game submission metadata and optional Formspree notifications.
- Cloud session creation, read/delete, and engine-side session verification.
- WebRTC ICE server configuration.
- Signed-in local pairing metadata without storing raw desktop engine tokens.
- Multiplayer lobby metadata and recent lobby discovery.
- Stream metric ingestion and recent metric reads.
- Cleanup jobs and production shared rate limiting.

The local engine still runs separately on `localhost:8080` and verifies cloud sessions through this API before booting catalog games.

```

## Local development

```sh
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

Default local URL:

```text
http://localhost:4000
```

Health and readiness probes:

```text
GET /
HEAD /
GET /health
GET /ready
```

If Supabase env vars are missing, authenticated routes return `503`. Production `/ready` also requires the shared rate-limit store.

## Verification

```sh
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build
```

Root-level API gate:

```sh
npm run verify:api
```

Hosted predeploy gate:

```sh
npm run predeploy:hosted
```

`predeploy:hosted` checks hosted access-log schema, submission cleanup policy, catalog RPC shape, catalog candidate import validation, typecheck, lint, and build.

## Auth model

Authenticated browser routes expect:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <supabase-access-token>
```

The engine calls:

```text
POST /sessions/:sessionId/verify
```

with the session token created by `POST /sessions`. This route is token-protected for server-to-engine verification rather than Supabase-bearer protected.

## Data boundary

The browser should not call Supabase tables, RPCs, or realtime channels directly. `apps/web/src/lib/api/*` is the frontend boundary for API-owned app data.

Browser-side Supabase use should stay limited to:

- Auth/session handling.
- Storage uploads that intentionally need direct signed-in client upload behavior, such as game submissions.

## Important route groups

| Group | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| System | `/`, `/health`, `/ready`, `/access-logs` |
| Identity | `/me`, `/me/permissions`, `/profile`, `/me/account` |
| Catalog | `/games`, `/games/featured`, `/games/:gameId`, `/games/:gameId/play-count` |
| Social | `/favorites`, `/games/:gameId/reactions`, `/games/:gameId/comments`, `/comments/:commentId/reaction`, moderation report routes |
| Admin | `/admin/users`, `/admin/reports`, `/admin/access-logs`, admin submission and catalog-candidate routes |
| Submissions | `/submissions/games` |
| Engine/control | `/webrtc/ice-servers`, `/sessions`, `/sessions/:id/verify`, local pairing routes, multiplayer lobby routes |
| Metrics | `/metrics/stream`, `/metrics/stream/recent` |

## Production environment

Minimum hosted env:

```txt
NODE_ENV=production
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=<provider port>
WEB_ORIGIN=https://pixelated-studio-edition.vercel.app,https://pixelated-user-edition.vercel.app
CONTROL_PLANE_CLEANUP_INTERVAL_MS=3600000
STREAM_METRIC_RETENTION_DAYS=7
STUN_URLS=stun:stun.l.google.com:19302
TURN_URLS=<optional comma-separated turn: or turns: URLs>
TURN_SHARED_SECRET=<optional coturn REST shared secret>
TURN_STATIC_USERNAME=<optional static TURN username>

BROWSER_ARTIFACT_URL_TTL_SECONDS=300
BROWSER_ARTIFACT_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=20
RATE_LIMIT_REDIS_REST_URL=<Upstash-compatible Redis REST endpoint>
RATE_LIMIT_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=<Redis REST bearer token>
RATE_LIMIT_REDIS_TIMEOUT_MS=1000
SUPABASE_URL=<your Supabase URL>
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your Supabase anon key>
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<your Supabase service role key>
```

Production readiness requires both Redis REST values. Local development may omit Redis and uses a bounded in-memory limiter.

User Edition WASM sessions require authentication. The API accepts `clientEdition: "user"` with
`runtimeKind: "wasm"`, validates the approved NES artifact, and replaces its permanent
`game_builds.artifact_url` with a short-lived signed URL in the session response. The canonical
private-bucket URL is unusable without signing. Browser-playable
artifacts must first be mirrored into the private `catalog_roms` Supabase Storage bucket. Public
cover/backdrop assets remain in `catalog_artifacts`. The
service-role key remains API-only and is never returned to either frontend.

Supabase Storage serves the signed object response directly. Before production deployment,
verify an actual signed artifact from the User Edition origin (including an `OPTIONS` request
and a browser download); do not fall back to an unrelated public host if that check fails.

Deploy 5.1 in this order:

1. From Pixelated Studio Edition only, review and apply
   `20260717100000_shared_user_edition_contract.sql`. Do not push or repair migrations from
   this repository.
2. Deploy the compatible shared API with both allowed frontend origins and the browser artifact
   TTL/rate-limit env. It supports both legacy public ROM URLs and new private URLs.
3. From the Studio repository, run `npm run mirror:catalog-artifacts -- --dry-run`, inspect the
   report, then repeat with `--apply`. This copies verified raw/legacy public ROMs into
   `catalog_roms` and updates `game_builds.artifact_url`; public artwork is untouched.
4. Test authenticated Studio and User Edition launches, signed URL expiry, CORS, checksum
   rejection, rate limiting, and idempotent play events.
5. Only after those checks pass, remove the old ROM objects from the public
   `catalog_artifacts` paths. Never delete artwork paths or use recursive bucket-wide cleanup.

Production enables Fastify proxy trust so `request.ip` uses the client address forwarded by Render's ingress. Keep production traffic behind a trusted ingress; do not expose the Node port directly while accepting client-supplied forwarded headers.

## Abuse-control limits

| Workflow | Limit | Coordination |
| --- | --- | --- |
| All non-health API requests | 600 per client IP per minute | Redis shared counter |
| Public catalog reads | 180 per client IP per minute | Redis shared counter |
| Liveness/readiness checks | 120 per client IP per minute | Redis shared counter |
| Session verification by IP | 1,000 per minute | Redis shared counter |
| Session verification by IP and session | 30 per minute | Redis shared counter |
| Comments | 10 per user per minute | Redis shared counter |
| Game and comment reactions combined | 120 per user per minute | Redis shared counter |
| Play-count writes | 60 per user per minute | Redis shared counter |
| Comment reports | 10 per user per hour | Redis shared counter |
| Game submissions | 3 per user per hour | Supabase submission rows |
| Stream metrics | 1 per user/session every 5 seconds | Supabase metric rows |

If Redis is temporarily unavailable, the API falls back to an in-memory limiter so protected routes remain available with per-instance abuse protection.

## Staging smoke

Before triggering Render API or Vercel web deploy hooks, run:

```sh
STAGING_API_URL=<render-api-url> \
STAGING_SUPABASE_URL=<staging-supabase-project-url> \
STAGING_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<staging-supabase-anon-key> \
STAGING_SMOKE_EMAIL=<dedicated-staging-admin-email> \
STAGING_SMOKE_PASSWORD=<dedicated-staging-admin-password> \
npm run predeploy:hosted
```

Run the broader hosted-stack smoke:

```sh
STAGING_API_URL=<render-api-url> \
STAGING_SUPABASE_URL=<staging-supabase-project-url> \
STAGING_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<staging-supabase-anon-key> \
STAGING_SMOKE_EMAIL=<dedicated-staging-admin-email> \
STAGING_SMOKE_PASSWORD=<dedicated-staging-admin-password> \
npm run smoke:staging
```

The smoke authenticates as a dedicated staging admin/super-admin account, verifies catalog cache behavior, identity/permissions, access-log schema, submission cleanup, local pairing save/read/delete, multiplayer lobby lifecycle, cloud session lifecycle, session verification, stream metric writes/reads, and admin access-log summary access when permitted.

Keep Supabase Auth CAPTCHA disabled on the staging project so CI can complete password-grant sign-in. `STAGING_BEARER_TOKEN` is still supported as a temporary fallback, but access tokens expire and should not be the normal staging configuration.

Recognized Supabase access-log schema failures return API code `access_log_schema_drift` with relevant migration names.

## GitHub Actions

`.github/workflows/hosted-api-deploy-gate.yml` runs:

- `npm run verify:api` on pull requests.
- Hosted predeploy checks on pushes, manual dispatches, and reusable hosted deploy calls.

`.github/workflows/hosted-deploy.yml` calls the deploy gate before Render/Vercel deploy hooks and then runs production hosted pairing/auth smokes.
